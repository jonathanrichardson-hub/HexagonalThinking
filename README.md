# 🪵 Hexagonal Thinking Tool

An interactive, web-based tool designed for students to explore relationships between concepts using a hexagonal thinking framework.

### ✨ Features
* **Dynamic Spawning:** Input terms via text box to generate custom hexagons.
* **Smart Locking:** Hexagons automatically "snap" and move as groups when placed near each other.
* **Individual Detaching:** Switch to "Move Singles" mode to pluck a hexagon out of a cluster.
* **Connection Notes:** Double-click any hexagon to explain the logic behind its placement.
* **Zero-Database Sharing:** Students can generate a shareable link that encodes their entire board into the URL.
